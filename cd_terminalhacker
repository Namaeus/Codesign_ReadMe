<p><strong>1.</strong> Unzip the <code>cd_spawnselect.zip</code> folder.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Paste your Authorisation Token into the file named <code>authorization</code>. This is located inside the main <code>cd_spawnselect</code> folder.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Install the SQL file. This is located inside the <code>READ_ME_AFTER_PURCHASING</code> folder, it’s named <code>cd_spawnselect_SQLFILE</code>.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Before starting the script, please read the <code>config.lua</code> (located inside the main cd_terminalhacker folder), the <code>config.js</code> (located inside the html/js folder) and the <code>customise_me</code>  (located inside the server and client folders) and configure the script to suit your servers needs.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>WARNING</strong> do not delete any files, do not change file names and do not edit the obfuscated files in any way, as this will result in you being blacklisted.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Add the script to your server start config: <code>start cd_spawnselect</code>. The name of the folder must not be changed or the script will not function correctly.</p>

<p><em>This script supports ESX and any other framework, but the method of triggering these events are slightly different. If your database does not have the <code>position</code> column in your <code>users</code> table, then you will have to use the custom framework method. All you will need to do is send the players last saved position in the database as the first argument.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The coordinates must be sent in a table (the table must include x, y, z).</li>
<li>You can also trigger this event from the server to client, just like you would with any other event.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using a multi-character script, we advise you to place the event inside that script, in a place where it will be triggered after you have chosen your character. But if you do not use a multi-character script, we advise you to place it inside your identity script, specifically at a place where your identity script checks if the player is a new or existing player.</p>
