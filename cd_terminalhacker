<p><strong>About the game</strong><br>
The point of the hacking game is to find the proper .exe file somewhere in a remote pcâ€™s directory.<br>
Some .exe files are corrupted and will set you back. (You need to figure which are which)<br>
Along your search path you are supposed to download additional files from the file system and gain score.<br>
Score and time taken determine the leaderboard placement, and the server owner can set their own actions based on time and score.</p>
