# INSTALLATION GUIDE
**1.** Unzip the `cd_props.zip` folder.

**2.** Paste your Authorisation Token into the file named `authorization,lua`. This is located inside the main `cd_props` folder.

 **3.** Before starting the resource, please read the `config.lua` (located inside the main cd_props folder) and  configure the resource to suit your servers needs.
 
 **4.** **WARNING** do not edit the obfuscated files in any way, as this will result in you being blacklisted.
 
 **5.** Add the resource to your server start config: `ensure cd_props`. The name of the folder must not be changed or the resource will not function correctly.

## Default Key binds
By default, you will be able to open the main props UI by using a key bind or a command, the command is `/prop` by default and the key binds are below.
> Numpad Minus - Open the main props UI menu.

> L - Pickup/drop props on the floor.

> Backspace - Delete props that are in your hand.

## Is the resource not working as expected?
 - Firstly always make sure the resource has started correctly. Check for obvious error prints. Then check the server console prints for a blue print saying `Authorised Successfully` and check for a client sided print saying `Successful`.
 - Make sure the name of the folder is `cd_props`.
 - If the resource has started correctly, and there are no errors, try changing the keys in the config to one that you know works, as one of your other resources may be disabling that specific key.
 - If all else fails, contact the Codesign Team in your private discord channel in the Codesign discord.
