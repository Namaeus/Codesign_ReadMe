## INSTALLATION GUIDE
**1.** Unzip the `cd_props.zip` folder.

**2.** Paste your Authorisation Token into the file named `authorization`. This is located inside the main `cd_props` folder.

**3.** Install the SQL file. This is located inside the `READ_ME_AFTER_PURCHASING` folder, it's named `cd_props_SQLFILE`.

 **4.** Before starting the script, please read the `config.lua` (located inside the main cd_props folder) and  configure the script to suit your servers needs.
 
 **5.** **WARNING** do not edit the obfuscated files in any way, as this will result in you being blacklisted.
 
 **6.** Add the script to your server start config: `start cd_props`. The name of the folder must not be changed or the script will not function correctly.

### Default Key-binds
*By default, you will be able to open the main props UI by using a keybind or a command, the command is `/prop` by default and the keybinds are below.*
> Numpad Minus - Open the main props UI menu.

> L - Pickup/drop props on the floor.

> Backspace - Delete props that are in your hand.

### Is the script not working as expected?
 - Firstly always make sure the script has started correctly. Check for obvious error prints. Then check the server console prints for a blue print saying `Authorised Successfully` and check for a client sided print saying `Successful`.
 - If the script has started correctly, and there are no errors, try changing the keys in the config to one that you know works, as one of your other scripts may be disabling that specific key.
 - If all else fails, contact the Codesign Team in your private discord channel in the Codesign discord.
